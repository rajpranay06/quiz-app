# Implementation Details

## User Authentication

Implemented Django authentication for user registration and login. Integrated Token Authentication using Django Rest Framework (DRF). Users receive a token upon login, which is required for API authentication.

# Quiz Creation

Users can create quizzes via an API (/create-quiz/).

Each quiz has a title, description, and creator (user) stored in the Quiz model.

# Adding Questions

Users can add questions via an API (/add-questions/<quiz_id>/).

Each question has 4 options, and one option is marked as correct. Used the Question model to store quiz-related questions.

# Playing a Quiz
Users can select a quiz and answer questions (/play_quiz/<quiz_id>/). Implemented form-based UI for answering questions.

The backend evaluates the answers and calculates scores.

# Updating & Deleting Quizzes
Users can edit quizzes they created (/update-quiz/<quiz_id>/).

Added a feature to delete individual questions or the entire quiz (/delete-quiz/<quiz_id>/).

# Security Features
Implemented Token Authentication for secure API access. CORS protection to allow frontend-backend communication.

Permissions enforced so only quiz creators can edit or delete their quizzes.

# Technologies Used
